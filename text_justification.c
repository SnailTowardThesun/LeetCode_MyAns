/*
Given an array of words and a length L,format the text such that each line has exactly L characters is fully(left and right)justified.
You should pack your words in a greedy approah:that is,pack as many words as your can in each line.Pad extra spaces '' whed necessary so that each line has exactly L characters.
Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If hte number of space on a line donot divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be saasigned more spaces than the slpts on the right.
For the last line of the text,it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted betwen words.

For example
words :["This","is","an","example","of","text","justification."]
L:16

return:
[
	"This    is    an"
	"example  of text"
	"justification.  "
]

	return NULL;

int main()
{
	printf("hello world\n");
